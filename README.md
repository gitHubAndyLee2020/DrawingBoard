# DrawingBoard

This is a web application that allows users to draw shapes on 80x32 grid, where they can also dynamically change colors using the search bar and select colors by their name or their hex code.
The user can click or drag on the grid to draw shapes, and they can click on the restart button at the top navigation bar to erase all of the colors.
